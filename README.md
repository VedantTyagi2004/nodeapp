## Introduction
The goal of this project is to automate the build, test, and deployment process for a Node.js application using a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline ensures reliable and consistent deployment to staging and production environments. It is configured using GitHub Actions, and the application is deployed to AWS EC2 instances using Docker.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the pipeline, ensure the following:
- A Node.js application with an Express.js backend.
- A Git repository hosted on GitHub.
- AWS EC2 instances for staging and production environments.
- A Docker Hub account for container image storage.
- GitHub repository secrets configured for sensitive data (e.g., SSH keys, AWS credentials, Docker Hub credentials).

## Pipeline Overview
The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. *Build*: Install dependencies and build the application.
2. *Test*: Run unit tests and fail the pipeline if any test fails.
3. *Code Quality Checks*: Run a linter (ESLint) to enforce coding standards.
4. *Docker Image Build and Push*: Build and push a Docker image to Docker Hub.
5. *Deployment to Staging*: Deploy the application to the staging environment.
6. *Deployment to Production*: Deploy the application to the production environment.

## Pipeline Script Breakdown
The complete pipeline script can be found in the .github/workflows/ directory of the GitHub repository. This YAML file defines the CI/CD workflow and is automatically triggered based on specified conditions (e.g., code commits or pull requests to the main or develop branches).

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Version Control Integration
1. *Create a Git Repository*:
   - Initialize a Git repository for your Node.js application.
   - Push the code to GitHub.
2. *Set Up Branching Strategy*:
   - Use main for production and develop for staging.
   - Protect these branches to prevent direct commits.

### CI/CD Pipeline Setup
1. *Choose a CI/CD Tool*:
   - Use GitHub Actions for this pipeline.
2. *Configure Triggers*:
   - Trigger the pipeline on code commits and pull requests to main and develop branches.

### Pipeline Stages

#### 1. Build
- *Objective*: Prepare the application for deployment by installing dependencies and building the project.
- *Steps*:
  - Checkout the code from the repository.
  - Set up Node.js using the specified version.
  - Install dependencies using npm ci (clean install).
  - Build the project for deployment.

#### 2. Test
- *Objective*: Ensure the application works as expected by running unit tests.
- *Steps*:
  - Run unit tests using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
  - Fail the pipeline if any test fails to ensure only working code is deployed.

#### 3. Code Quality Checks
- *Objective*: Maintain code quality by enforcing coding standards.
- *Steps*:
  - Run ESLint to check for coding standard violations.
  - Optionally, integrate static analysis tools like SonarQube for deeper insights.

#### 4. Docker Image Build and Push
- *Objective*: Containerize the application and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
- *Steps*:
  - Checkout the code.
  - Log in to Docker Hub using credentials stored in GitHub Secrets.
  - Build the Docker image and push it to Docker Hub with the specified tag.

#### 5. Deployment to Staging
- *Objective*: Deploy the application to the staging environment for testing.
- *Steps*:
  - Checkout the code.
  - Set up SSH key for the staging server using GitHub Secrets.
  - Add the staging server to known hosts.
  - Deploy the application by pulling the latest code, installing dependencies, building, and restarting the application using PM2.

#### 6. Deployment to Production
- *Objective*: Deploy the application to the production environment.
- *Steps*:
  - Checkout the code.
  - Set up SSH key for the production server using GitHub Secrets.
  - Add the production server to known hosts.
  - Deploy the application by pulling the latest Docker image, stopping and removing the existing container, and running the new container.

### Monitoring and Logging
1. *Set Up Monitoring*:
   - Use Prometheus with Grafana or AWS CloudWatch for monitoring.
2. *Implement Centralized Logging*:
   - Use ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd for logging.

### Security Enhancements
1. *Scan Dependencies*:
   - Use npm audit or Snyk to scan for vulnerabilities.
2. *Manage Environment Variables*:
   - Use GitHub Secrets Manager for sensitive data like SSH keys, AWS credentials, and Docker Hub credentials.

## Deliverables
1. *Fully Functional CI/CD Pipeline*:
   - The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process.
2. *Documentation*:
   - This document explains the pipeline stages and how to configure and use the pipeline.

## Conclusion
This CI/CD pipeline ensures reliable and consistent deployment of a Node.js application to staging and production environments. By automating the build, test, and deployment process, the pipeline reduces manual errors and speeds up the development cycle. The use of Docker and AWS EC2 instances ensures scalability and portability.
